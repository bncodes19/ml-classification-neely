- The notebook structure is easy to follow. There is a titel, author, and the notebook is dated. There is also an introduction and labeled sections. There are also excellent visualizations in the notebook.
- The chose features make sense for this dataset (Mushroom Dataset). The features chosen were: odor and gill color.
- Section 4 has a clear and concise reflection of the model performance. The reflection includes accuracy of the training and test set as well as detailed information on precision and recall. There is also a Section 5 reflection for the alternative model chosen: Random Forest.
- The insights in this notebook are labeled and very detailed. There is a summarization section, challenges faced, and future exploration section. All of these make a valuable insight section in Section 6.
